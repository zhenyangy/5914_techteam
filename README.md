## TensorFlow Introduction

TensorFlow is an open source Library for doing Complex Numerical Computation to build machine learning models, which is developed by Google Brain team. TensorFlow is written in C++ but is quite user-friendly to python interface. TensorFlow has three main components TensorFlow(API), TensorFlow Serving and TensorBoard. TensorFlow(API) contains the API's to develop models and to train the models with data. TensorFlow Serving is designed to deploy the models. And TensorBoard is designed to visualize, analyze, and debug machine learning models.
From my perspective, TensorFlow is currently most popular and powerful framework for building deep learning model.

## Install
I am now going to introduce how to install TensorFlow on macOS 10.12.6 (Sierra) or higher.
Right now, the most popular programming language that use TensorFlow is python. Below is a screenshot from github by searching "tensorflow"
